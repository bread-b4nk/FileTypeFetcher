# Contributing

- Package installation uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/), but this is subject to change in the future. 

- We use [git-flow workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for our development. Depending on the kind of feature you are contributing, create a `hotfix` branch or a `feature` branch. Installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation).

- We also require a pre-commit hook. You can follow the instructions [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install) to install them.

- You will need to install the hooks in the `yaml` file in the repository using the following command: `pre-commit install`.
